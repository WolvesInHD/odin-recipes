The Odin Project Recipes project. Completing the HTML version of the assignment starting on 8/28/2024. I will be able to complete a HTML boiler plate, make use of image links, anchors, unordered lists, ordered lists, headings, and other HTML concepts. I will return later to add CSS to improve the look of the website.
